# TIGRESS-PHANGS
A private respository for the backup of the codes of my Master of Science final thesis, which is aimed at the interpretation of multi-wavelenght observations of local, main-sequence, star forming, spiral galaxies (of the PHANGS survey) through the post-processing of high-resolution simulated environments of MW-like galaxies (belonging to the TIGRESS simulations).
